# Code-Refactor

This is my first homework assignment to refactor code.  In this assignment I will fix the existing code to semantic standards and make it easy to read for future updates if needed.

This assignment was tough to start, but once I broke down all the criteria it was not as hard as I first thought.  I started from the bottom up working on the title element first.  I chenged the title that was given to be more descriptive and in-line with the company page.  I reloaded the website to make sure that the changes saved, and when that was confirmed I moved on to the next task.  

Once I had that fixed I fixed the heading attributes.  Putting the h tags in sequential order from top to bottom.  I put them in order as they apear in the elements.  For example the heading has an h1 tag for the heading of the page.  The next element is in my Main area, and within that I have a section and article that has h1, h2, and h3 tags for the headers.  My aside element has h1, h2, and h3 tags for the headings to fall in order there.  Finally my footer has an h1 tag since there is only 1 heading in that element.

Next I added alt attributes to all image elements on the page.  None of the images had an alt associated with them.  So I added alt attributes that would display what was being convayed if the image failed to load, or due to a slow connection.

Next I had to work on the structure of elements.  I moved the code to be more fluid and clean looking.  It now shows proper indentation and spacing when viewing in order to make future updates and changed easier to apply.

The final task I attacked was to implement semantic elements into the source code.  I changed around a lot of the div tags and removed classes altogether to accomplish this.  I made a main element that has a section, article, and aside built into it.  I changed the header and footers from div tags with classes to just being a header section and footer section.  I also added a nav element within the header for the ul,li elements and kept it in-line with the page layout. 

In conclusion this assignment was daugnting at first glance, but once I broke the elements down it was not as hard as I first dpreceived.
